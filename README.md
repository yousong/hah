hah echoes back to [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)

It's a tiny WebSocket, HTTP, TCP, UDP server capable of listening on multiple
ports echoing back request info.

It was written for testing out loadbalancer setups.  The program was originally
known as
[echoserver](https://github.com/yousong/gists/tree/master/python/echoserver)
and written in Python with tornado and some C extention code.  It's rewritten
here for easier deployment and better performance.
